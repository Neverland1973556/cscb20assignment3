                Course website</a><br>

            Course information, lecture notes, tutorial material, important
            announcements, etc. will be posted on the course website. It is
            your responsibility to visit it frequently.

            Email communication<br>

            Questions regarding the course material, assignments, midterm,
            etc. should be posed on the bulletin board. Questions about
            the assignment which you feel you cannot formulate without
            revealing your solution (should be very rare!), as well as
            questions and concerns regarding your personal matters should
            be directed to the instructor.

                Discussion board</a><br>

            You are encouraged to use the bulletin board to discuss the
            course material, pose questions on the assignments, etc. The
            bulletin board will be monitored by the instructor and by your
            TAs. Please, be very careful not to reveal (parts of) your
            solution on the bulletin board.
